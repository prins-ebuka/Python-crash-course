#Inheritance
#This is used when you don't want to write a Class you've written before from scratch
#If the class you are writing is a specialized version of the class you have written,...
#you can use 'inheritance'.
#When you’re writing a new class based on an existing class, you’ll often...
#want to call the __init__() method from the parent class. This will initialize...
#any attributes that were defined in the parent __init__() method and make...
#them available in the child class...

#Let us create an Electric Car based on the class Car

#Defining Attributes and Methods for the Child Class
